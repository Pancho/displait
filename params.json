Nothing special.\r\n\r\nHowever once the window is loaded, you can do the following:\r\n* Move it around by dragging the collapsible handle\r\n* Resize it by dragging the handle in the lower right corner of the window\r\n* Rename and change its destination URL\r\n* Force refresh every 30 seconds\r\n* Change the render of the window\r\n\r\nHow to deploy\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nThere is no back end (which is why I don't even call this an application) so deployment is really easy: just copy and paste it wherever you wish.\r\n\r\n### Local deployment:\r\nJust fetch and unpack the zip or check out the project and navigate to the index.html file from your browser.\r\nNOTE: non http(s) protocols in Internet Explorer browsers don't provide localStorage, which is crucial for this project (hint: chose a different browser if all else fails). In our case, if we navigate to a file, the protocol will be file:// which is no good for IE.\r\n\r\n### Web server\r\nCopy the contents of project to your server and visit the URL you've set up.","google":"UA-48142446-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
